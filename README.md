# Requirements Analysis

This is a summary of the training course of the Requirements Analysis

 - Module Focus:

    - Business Analysis
    - Requirements Analysis


## Business Analysis:

    - Understand and describe a company's processes.
    - Example: Life cycle of entities (e.g.: order or book status).

## Requirements Analysis:

    - Specify the system's functionalities.
    - Example: Use cases (user interaction with the system).

### Process to build a software:

#### The software development process involves disciplines and subprocesses, such as analysis, design, construction and validation.
- Analysis: Describes the problem.
- Design: Describes the solution.
- Construction: Implements the solution.
- Certification: Tests and validates the solution before delivery.
- The waterfall model follows a linear sequence, where each step is completed before moving on to the next.
- The waterfall model is best suited for areas such as civil engineering, but is not ideal for software development, which is more dynamic and cyclical.

- The unified process is a framework created by Booch, Rumbaugh and Jacobson, which organizes the disciplines in an iterative and incremental manner.
- The unified process divides development into phases: initiation, elaboration, construction and transition.
- The disciplines (business modeling, requirements, analysis, design, implementation, testing, etc.) are applied in different intensities throughout these phases.
- The unified process is iterative and incremental, meaning that disciplines are applied repeatedly in cycles, with continuous improvement.
- Variants of the unified process include the Rational Unified Process (RUP), OpenUP, and Agile Unified Process (AUP).
- Analysis is a subprocess that describes the problem and is part of an incremental process in software development.

- Comparison with Building Construction:

   - Stages: Analysis (understanding the problem), Design (solution design), Construction (implementation), Homologation (validation).

## Artifacts in Business Analysis:
- Business process specification document.
- Entity life cycle.

## Artifacts in Systems Analysis:

### Requirements Analysis:
- Overview of the system (free document).
- Overview of use cases (diagram).
- Specification of use cases (structured document).

### Domain Analysis:
- Conceptual model (data model at the analysis level).

## Difference between Artifact and Tool:
- Artifact: what you want to specify (e.g. business process).
- Tool: means used to specify (e.g. UML activity diagram).

### Examples of Tools:

- Activity diagram (UML) to specify the flow of actions of the business process.
- State machine diagram (UML) for the life cycle of entities.
- Use case diagram (UML) for an overview of use cases.
- Class diagram (UML) for the conceptual model.

## Free and Structured Documents:
- System overview: free document.
- Use case specification: structured document.

## Importance of Differentiating Artifact and Tool:
- The artifact is the final product (e.g., business process).
- The tool is just a means to create the artifact (e.g., activity diagram).

## Definition of Information System: 
- Organizational system used to collect, store and disseminate data.
- Used by companies and organizations to automate business processes.

## Characteristics of Information Systems: 
- Database with business information.
- Forms, reports and process automation (e.g.: purchases, inventory, employees).

## Information Systems Analysis Process: 
- Focused on systems for companies and organizations.
- Main subprocesses: 
    - Business Analysis: Understanding and describing the business, its rules and processes.
    - Systems Analysis: Understanding the needs and requirements to build the system.

## Subdivisions of Systems Analysis:
- Requirements Analysis: Identify what the system needs to do.
- Domain Analysis: Understand the context and environment of the system.

## Objective of Information Systems:
- Automate parts of business processes, making them more efficient.
- Example: Automate calculations and payroll generation in the financial sector.

## Importance of Business Analysis:
- Understanding the business is a prerequisite for specifying an appropriate system.
- Although it is not a systems analysis, business analysis is essential to the process.
